Configuring your Build Environment
----------------------------------

The build tree relies on Maven 3 for executing unit tests and 
integration tests across the 3 platforms (GAE, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
The source tree is in the top level project within Maven.  The 
directories underneath are Eclipse projects and/or Maven 
sub-projects.  

If you're a Maven expert and have suggestions about the Maven 
project tree, please contact mitchellsundt@gmail.com

=====================
Minimal Eclipse Setup
---------------------

For executing only in Eclipse with the bare minimum, you need the 
odk-gae-settings project and the eclipse-aggregate-gae 
project.  These should not require any Maven setup.

Skip to the next section if you want a fully configured development environment.

The steps required are:

(0) Install the latest Java 7 SDK

(1a) Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE -- Kepler (4.3.2). Luna has not been tested.

(1b) Increase the start-up memory sizes for the Eclipse workspace as detailed 
below. The GAE database consumes huge amounts of space in the JVM and the GAE
environment runs two independent copies of the server code to mimic the existence
of a foreground and background process. This all requires very large perm space
and max memory for the underlying Java environments.

To do this, edit the eclipse.ini file, located in the
eclipse directory (e.g., C:\Users\User\eclipse\eclipse.ini).  This is 
in the same directory as the eclipse.exe.

This is my eclipse.ini:
------------------------------start-------------------
-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20130327-1440.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.200.v20140116-2212
-product
org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
1536M
-showsplash
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
1536m
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
--launcher.appendVmargs
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.7
-Xms100m
-Xmx3048m
-XX:MaxPermSize=1536m
------------------------------end----------------------

(2) Install Google Eclipse Plugin with App Engine SDK and Google Web Toolkit SDK.

(3) Start Eclipse.  Choose the parent directory of the clone'd repository as your workspace.

Windows / Preferences:

  Google / App Engine:
  
    Be sure there is an App Engine 1.9.7 or higher SDK defined.
	If the default App Engine version is not 1.9.7, you may need to 
	tweak with the project settings to get the newer jars to be added.

  Google / Web Toolkit:
  
    Be sure there is a WebToolkit SDK defined 2.6.1 or higher.
	The default GWT version should match that in the maven 
	pom.xml (currently 2.6.1).  The GWT library is installed as 
	part of the plugin and can be found in:
	...\eclipse\plugins\com.google.gwt.eclipse.sdkbundle_2.6.1...\gwt-2.6.1

File / Import:

    Choose the directory of the clone'd repository as the directory to search
	(this is one level below the workspace directory).
	
	Choose ONLY the eclipse-aggregate-gae and odk-gae-settings projects.

	This should refresh and build with one error (a missing odk-settings-latest.jar).
	
(4)	Edit odk-gae-settings / common / security.properties

In this file:

Set the security.server.superUser to your gmail account.

Additionally, set the security.server.hostname=
(blank) to a dynamic DNS name or IP for your development box.

Save.

(5) In the odk-gae-settings project, select 
the 'build.xml' (Ant Buildfile), right-click, and 
choose Run As / Ant Build.  This will rebuild the configuration 
jar and copy it into the eclipse project.

(6) Refresh the eclipse-aggregate-gae project (to pick up the updated jar file).

This should now build without errors.  

On Eclipse, these additional steps may also be required:

Select eclipse-aggregate-gae
right-click Properties

under /Builders

de-select Enhancer (based on the bug: http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1970 )

under /Google/App Engine

toggle the App Engine SDK between the default and specific settings (to make a 
rebuild as per instructions http://code.google.com/p/opendatakit/wiki/EclipseDebugging )

(7) Select eclipse-aggregate-gae project.

Click on the red toolbox (GWT compile) to compile the GWT Java code into javascript.
For the Project, specify 'eclipse-gae-project'. This should auto-populate the 
'Entry Point Modules' section and highlight 'AggregateUI'.  If not, click Add and 
choose 'AggregateUI' as the entry point module to compile. If you ever need to browse
to this, it is located under:

  Package: org.opendatakit.aggregate
  Filename: AggregateUI.gwt.xml

Click on 'Advanced' to open more options.

In the 'VM Arguments' section, add:

-Xmx1536m

Click 'Compile'

This should now compile.

==================================
Running or Debugging under Eclipse
==================================

Select eclipse-aggregate-gae project.

The first time you run or debug, you need to increase the JVM sizes

Run As 'Run Configurations...'
Debug As 'Debug Configurations...'

Choose 'Web Application'

Open this up, and select 'index.html'

On the '(X)= Arguments' tab, replace the '-Xmx512m' at the front of the 'VM Arguments' section with:

-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1536m 

Click 'Run' or 'Debug'

This should start up the server.

GWT UI debugging needs to be done on a Chrome browser.

==================================
Debugging GWT UI in Chrome Browser
==================================

Open a Chrome browser

Go to Tools / Extensions

Choose to 'Get more extensions'

Search for 'GWT Developer Plugin' and install it.

Ensure that it is enabled.

Now paste in the URL from Eclipse's 'Development Mode' tab into 
your browser. This will typically be:

http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html?gwt-server=127.0.0.1:9997

This will redirect to the login screen. After logging in
you will then be redirected to the Aggregate.html page and the
main UI.

At this point, the query string, ?gwt-server=127.0.0.1:9997
may drop off. This will disconnect the UI rendering from the 
client Java code, causing the rendering to fall back to the
last manually compiled GWT code. Be on the alert for this.
If it happens, just add the query string back into the URL 
before the hash (#) mark.

The URL should show have a red GWT toolbox to its right. If this
ever changes to gray, you need to click on the toolbox and allow
the new hostname and port to access GWT. If you specify an IP address
or hostname in the security.properties file, you generally need to 
do this (you would need to do that in order for a device to reach
your server).

=====================
MySQL Eclipse Setup
---------------------

First, get the eclipse-aggregate-gae project working.

You will then copy the war directory of that project over to the 
eclipse-aggregate-mysql project, and tweak it. 

See the SETUP.txt instructions in the eclipse-aggregate-mysql
directory for further information.

The class files seem to get stuck and not Publish when running
under Tomcat 6.0 and MySQL. The work-around for this is to 
Stop the server and Clean... it, then Start it. This seems to 
make everything current.

==========================================
Troubleshooting Debugging/Running 
------------------------------------------

(1) Javascript refresh loop 

If the database schema has changed, the browser may flash
and be stuck in a javascript refresh loop.  To remedy,
delete your local datastore (instructions below)

(2) Odd behaviors under Eclipse

The Eclipse GWT plugin does not normally keep the compiled
client-side javascript up to date with the debug-enabled
GWT Java client code.  This can cause a number of inconsistencies
when the ?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997 query string is dropped 
off the URL during redirects when logging in, etc.

First, verify that if you are running under debug, you have
the ?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997 query string on your URLs.

Second, periodically, when stopped, click on the red toolbox
to compile the javascript.

Third, periodically clear your browser cache to force a complete
re-loading of the clientside javascript.

Fourth, if you have moved or changed client interfaces, you 
may need to manually browse to the war diretory and delete 
the contents of the war/aggregateui and war/WEB-INF/deploy
directories.  

(3) Odd errors about locking scopes.

If you are debugging code within a transaction
region (these are presently isolated to TaskLockImpl.java),
the datastore can get confused about the transaction scopes
that are active.  You may need to close eclipse, re-open, 
and delete the datastore to clear this problem.

-----------------------
Clearing your Datastore
-----------------------

To delete the local datastore:

(1) In Eclipse, browse to war/WEB-INF/appengine-generated
(2) Hit Refresh
(3) delete "local_db.bin"

==========================================
Full Maven Development Environment Configuration
------------------------------------------

(1) Install Maven 3.  This document assumes Maven 3.0.4 or higher.
    This will generally set up a maven repository under
    the user's home directory:  ${HOME}/.m2/repository

(2) Install Java 7 JDK.

(3) Install Eclipse Kepler (4.3.2) or higher. Luna has not been tested.

(4) Install Google Eclipse Plugin with App Engine SDK and Google Web Toolkit SDK.

(5) Optionally Install Tomcat 6.0.  
    This is required unless you do not import or always keep closed
    the MySQL and Postgres projects and don't use maven.

(6) Optionally: Install Postgres

For Postgres, run these commands:

----postgres-script-start-----
create database "odk_unit";
create schema "odk_unit";
create user "odk_unit" with unencrypted password 'odk_unit';
grant all privileges on database "odk_unit" to "odk_unit";
alter database "odk_unit" owner to "odk_unit";
----postgres-script-end-------

From the Postgres SQL shell (psql) commandline client,
using the root account and password, if the above commands
are in the file postgres.sql, you can type:

\cd C:/your_path_no_spaces_forward_slashes_only
\i postgres.sql
\q

(6) Optionally: Install MySQL

(6a)
For MySQL, run this script:

UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('odk_unit') WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CREATE USER 'odk_unit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'odk_unit';
CREATE DATABASE odk_unit;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON odk_unit.* TO 'odk_unit'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

(6b)
For MySQL, download and copy the MySQL Connector J jar into the Tomcat /lib
directory (mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar to apache-tomcat-6.0.26/lib).
You must stop tomcat, if it is running, in order for the library to be detected.

For Maven (3) is optional; (4), (5) and (6) are required in order
to perform a full build.

----------

(7) Register libraries in Maven: (this is also required for Eclipse builds)

Run the ANT script (build.xml) under:

src/main/libs/ -- registers various jars into your local maven repo.

To run, just cd to this directory and type 'ant'

See the src/main/libs/readme.txt for information about these jars.

(8a) Download and install Firefox ESR 24. This is a slowly-upgrading version
of Firefox, since the upgrade cycle of Firefox is too rapid for Selenium
(our UI testing framework) to keep up.

(8) Download tomcat 6 and selenium java client for full-stack integration / web UI tests.

Run the ANT script (build.xml) under:

build/   -- downloads a Tomcat 6 zip and selenium java client (for full-stack integration / web UI tests)

To run, just cd to this directory and type 'ant'
 
(9) Edit Maven's settings.xml file (this is in the .m2 directory).

A minimal file is:

<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
	<server>

  </servers>
  <profiles>
  	<profile>

  	  <activation><activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault></activation>
  	  <properties>

		<test.server.gae.monitor.port>7075</test.server.gae.monitor.port>
		<unix.display>:20.0</unix.display>
		<firefox.executable></firefox.executable>
	  </properties>
  	</profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>

Be sure to update the paths and passwords to match those of your environment.

The installer is not hooked into the parent Maven project, but identifies that project as its
parent.  So you can build the top-level project to build and run unit tests, integration tests, 
etc. and do not need bitrock installed.

The aggregate-mysql war file is used as the starting point for the installer build process.

=========================
Maven Command Line Builds
=========================

(12) Maven command-line builds are done as follows:

mvn clean 

This cleans the workspace, removing all temporary files.
If this errors out, verify that there are no orphaned java
executables running. If the GAE tests crash, they can leave
a java database background process running.

mvn install

This will build and install the projects, running the unit tests
against the 3 datastores (Google BigTable, MySQL, Postgresql),
and building the wars for the 3 platforms.

(13) If you have bitrock installed and licensed, you can 
build the bitrock installer.  First, 
 copy aggregate-mysql\target\aggregate-mysql-1.0.war bitrock-installer
 cd bitrock-installer
 mvn clean
 mvn install
Open bitrock and open the buildWar.xml project file in this directory.
On the packaging page, build for windows, linux, linux-64 and OSX.

On Windows, the generated installers are placed under:

C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\InstallBuilder\output
