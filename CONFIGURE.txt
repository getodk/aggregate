==================================
Configuring your Build Environment
----------------------------------

The build tree relies on Maven 3 for executing unit tests and 
integration tests across the 3 platforms (GAE, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Sources are located under

 src/        -- main source code, configuration files, and libraries
 war-base/   -- static web content and libraries for Eclipse environment
 
Because GWT and AppEngine have not historically respected and worked
with Maven projects inside Eclipse, the non-Maven directories of our 
Eclipse projects begin with "eclipse-" prefix.

There are two sets of these:

For AppEngine:

   eclipse-ear
   eclipse-default
   eclipse-n-background
   
For MySQL or PostgreSQL:

   eclipse-tomcat6

Additionally, when using Eclipse, you must also import one of these projects
into your environment:

  odk-gae-settings
  odk-mysql-settings
  odk-postgresql-settings
  

If you're a Maven expert and have suggestions about the Maven 
project tree, please contact mitchellsundt@gmail.com

===========================================
Critically Important Configuration Notes!!!!
-------------------------------------------

(1) You MUST use Java 7. 

Java 8 (and anything other than Servlet 2.5) are not supported by AppEngine.
If you use Java 8, Springframework will use a blacklisted reflection API
and you will NOT be able to run the server locally under AppEngine or
deploy it remotely.

(2) When running Google's AppEngine Eclipse plug-in and development server, the 
plug-in will scan files and delete any that contain Servlet-3.0 functionality.

Unfortunately, this includes the spring-web jar. To work around this, you must
explode the jar, remove the overview.html and WEB-INF/web-fragment.xml files, 
and then re-construct the jar.  To work around this problem, there is a 
suitably modified jar here: war-base/WEB-INF/lib/spring-web-SEE-CONFIGURE-TXT-....jar


==================================
Minimal Eclipse Installation Setup
----------------------------------
See the next section if you want a fully configured Maven build environment.

You will probably want a computer with at least 8GB of main memory for development purposes.

On Windows, you can confirm the signature of the downloads using certutil. See https://opendatakit.org/help/verifying-downloaded-files/
(This is a good habit for you to adopt). 

(1) Download and install the Java 7 JDK ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html )

(2) Download the "Mars.2 (4.5.2)" "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" (be sure it is the Java EE version) ( https://eclipse.org/downloads/ )
we use the 64-bit IDE. 

(3) Extract Eclipse into a directory (e.g., c:\Users\your-user\eclipse

(4) Use Notepad++ or similar editor to edit the eclipse.ini within this folder
(this file is in the same directory as the eclipse.exe.). We need to
increase the start-up memory sizes for the Eclipse workspace as detailed 
below. The GAE database consumes huge amounts of space in the JVM and the GAE
environment runs two independent copies of the server code to mimic the existence
of a foreground and background process. This all requires very large perm space
and max memory for the underlying Java environments.

To do this, change -Xms... and the following lines in that file to:
-Xms256m
-Xmx3048m
-XX:PermSize=1536m
-XX:MaxPermSize=1536m

This is my eclipse.ini:
------------------------------start-------------------
-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.100.v20150511-1540.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417
-product
org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256M
-showsplash
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
--launcher.appendVmargs
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.7
-Xms256m
-Xmx3048m
-XX:PermSize=1536m
-XX:MaxPermSize=1536m
------------------------------end----------------------

(5)  Download "Google AppEngine SDK for Java". We currently use 1.9.34
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads 
 (scroll down).
 
 And extract the SDK.
 
(6) Download "GWT SDK". We currently use 2.7.0
http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html

And extract the SDK.

===============================
Minimal AppEngine Eclipse Setup
-------------------------------
This assumes you have completed "Minimal Eclipse Installation Setup"

(1) Finally, start Eclipse (Mars) and select the cloned source code directory/folder as the workspace folder.

(2) Go to Help / Install New Software.

Choose Add...

And register an entry for this URL  https://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.4

After registering, when it presents available software to install, do not install
the SDKs. At a minimum, you need to install:

Google Plugin for Eclipse / Google Plugin for Eclipse 4.4/4.5

(you don't need anything else)

Proceed with installing this and restarting Eclipse.

(3) Re-open Eclipse, go to Window / Preferences

Open Google / App Engine and add the AppEngine SDK path that you downloaded and exploded in (5) in earlier section

Open Google / Web Toolkit and add the GWT SDK path of what you downloaded and exploded in (6) in earlier section

Choose OK to accept changes and close the preferences dialog.

(4) Once again, go to Window / Preferences

Open Server /Runtime Environment

Select Google AppEngine 

If it complains about not having an AppEngine SDK then delete this and 
Select Add, choose Google / AppEngine, and accept the defaults to re-create it.

Choose OK to accept changes and close the preferences dialog.

(At this point, Eclipse has the basic AppEngine / GWT configuration.)

(5) If you haven't already, go to the Workbench view. Then, 
Import / Import... / General / Existing Projects into Workspace

import these existing projects:

odk-gae-settings
eclipse-default
eclipse-n-background
eclipse-ear

(6) Within odk-gae-settings, open common and edit security.settings

Update the security.server.hostname to correspond to your system IP address.
Remember the IP address. You could use "localhost" for this if you are not
attempting to debug the communications between ODK Aggregate and a device 
(i.e., only working on the web UI).

You can find out your IP address by opening a cmd window and running 
ipconfig (or, on Mac/Linux, running ifconfig -a).

By default, when running the AppEngine Development Server, it uses port 8888. 
Be sure that this file has

security.server.port=8888

Save changes.

(7) Select build.xml within odk-gae-settings. Right-click, Run As / Ant Build

(8) Select eclipse-default, right-click, Refresh

(9) Select eclipse-n-background, right-click, Refresh

(10) Choose File / New / Other... / Server / Server

Select Google / Google App Engine as the server type

Enter your computer's IP address as the Server's host name.

Click Next.

Enter 0  in HRD unapplied job percentage.

Click Next.

Add eclipse-ear to the configured resources.

Click Finish.

(11) Now, Select eclipse-default, right-click, Properties

Select "Deployment Assembly"

Select any "Google App Engine Web Libraries" or "Google App Engine" entries and remove them.
Select and remove the "App Engine SDK" entry.

Click Apply

Go to Java Build Path / Libraries

Select "Server Library" and remove it.
Select any "Google App Engine Web Libraries" or "Google App Engine" entries and remove them.
Select and remove the "App Engine SDK" entry.

Click "Add Library"

Choose Server Runtime / Google AppEngine (1.9.34)

And accept it (this will create a Google App Engine entry).

Click "Add Library"

Choose Google App Engine

And accept it (this will create an App Engine SDK entry).

Go to Java Build Path / Order and Export

Ensure that:
 Web App Libraries
 GWT
 App Engine SDK

are checked and in that order

Click Apply

Select "Deployment Assembly"

Choose Add... / Java Build Path Entries 

Select:
  AppEngine SDK

Click Apply
(you may need to repeat this twice to get it to remain)

Select "Project Facets"  

Choose "Google AppEngine (for single module)"

Click on the Runtimes tab.

Check the "Google App Engine" entry that has the stylized airplane icon.
(if there is one that looks like a server box, that App Engine sdk is missing from your workspace; uncheck it).

Click Apply

Choose "Server"

Choose the server that you configured earlier (in step (10)).

Click Apply

Click OK

(12) Now, Select eclipse-n-background, right-click, Properties

and repeat all the steps in (11) above.

(13) Now, Select eclipse-ear, right-click, Properties

Select "Project Facets"  

Choose "Google AppEngine (for multiple modules)"

Click on the Runtimes tab.

Check the "Google App Engine" entry that has the stylized airplane icon.
(the one that looks like a server box is missing from your workspace; uncheck that).

Click Apply

Choose "Server"

Choose the server that you configured earlier (in step (10)).

Click Apply

Click OK

(14) Select eclipse-default, right-click Google / GWT Compile

open Advanced

Verify that "Additional compiler arguments" has:

-war WebContent

Verify that VM Arguments has:

-Xmx512m

Choose Compile.

Wait for the compile to complete (it is compiling the Java code into 
5 different sets of Javascript to support 5 different browsers).

(15) Select eclipse-default, right-click Refresh to pick up the 
changes to the compiled GWT files (this is important!!!)

(16) Create an explicit development server configuration

Select eclipse-ear, right-click, Debug As / Debug Configurations

Double-click to choose Google App Engine

Rename "New_Configuration" to something of your choosing (e.g., devServerGAE)

Click Apply

Close.

(17) Now, choose eclipse-ear, right-click, Debug As / Debug on Server

This will initialize and start the server configuration you created above.
It will fail with an out-of-memory error.

Stop the server by clicking the red square box on the Console output window.

----------------------------------------
(18) Select eclipse-ear, right-click, Debug As / Debug Configurations

Select the Google App Engine configuration you created in step (16).

Select the (X)= Arguments tab.

In the Program Arguments section, add:

--address=0.0.0.0 

before the --port entry.

In the VM Arguments section, replace "-Xmx512m" with

 "-XX:PermSize=1536m -XX:MaxPermSize=1536m -Xms256m -Xmx3048m "
 
Click Apply

Choose Close
-------
If you've done this correctly, the Program Arguments would be something like:

--address=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --disable_update_check [path...to...]\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\eclipse-ear

And the VM Arguments section should become something like:

-javaagent:[path...to...]\appengine-java-sdk-1.9.34\lib\agent\appengine-agent.jar -XX:PermSize=1536m -XX:MaxPermSize=1536m -Xms256m -Xmx3048m  -Dappengine.fullscan.seconds=5

If you tried to skip a step, the server might not be configured correctly.

(after Applying these changes, choose Close if you haven't already)

----------------------------------------
(19) Select the Servers tab in the output area.

Right-click on the server you created. Choose Clean....

This will delete the datastore and rebuild the server based upon the updated configuration.

(20) To run or debug, **YOU CANNOT right-click the server and choose Run or Debug**
If you do this, all of the settings you changed in step (18) will be lost.

Instead, **YOU MUST** select eclipse-ear, right-click, Debug As / Debug Configurations (Run As / Run Configurations)

This will open up the configuration you made in step (18).

Choose Debug (Run)

Now open a browser at http://localhost:8888

It should redirect to your Aggregate instance at the IP address you specified.

You may need to clear your browser cache if you are using GWT SuperDevMode
and re-configure the browser for that (e.g., the bookmark buttons).

========================================
AppEngine Edit-Debug Cycle Considerations
========================================

Now, you should be able to Debug the server-side code using the
AppEngine development server. When you are developing, as you 
change code, you will probably need to start and stop the server.

If you change the UI layer, you will want to re-run the GWT compiler,
and Refresh the project (in the eclipse-default project, where the UI
code is).

You may need to clear your browser cache if you are using GWT SuperDevMode
and re-configure the browser for that (e.g., the bookmark buttons).

If you are working with GWT code, you can work in SuperDevMode
where you set breakpoints within the Chrome development environment.

See farther down (below) for configuring GWT.

If something is not picked up, you can try cleaning all the projects
and also Clean the server (via right-click on the server on the Servers
tab). This should refresh everything.  Note, however, that this will
delete the datastore, too.

The most likely problem during development is the inadvertent clearing of 
the settings you configured in step 17, above. 

======================================
Minimal Tomcat6 MySQL/PostgreSQL Eclipse Setup
--------------------------------------

This assumes you have completed "Minimal Eclipse Installation Setup"

(including the download of the AppEngine SDK and GWT SDK. These are needed to resolve symbols when
compiling the source code, even when running under Tomcat6.)

(1) Install Tomcat6 on your computer.

(2) download MySQL Connector/J and place it in the lib directory of the Tomcat install.
Stop and restart the Tomcat6 server so it picks up that library. This must be present
for MySQL connections to work. It does not harm anything if this is present when using 
PostgreSQL.

(3) install the database server of your choice (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
NOTE:  Be sure that it is configured using a UTF-8 character set as the default.

(4) Start Eclipse (Mars) and select this ODK Aggregate workspace. 

Go to Help / Install New Software.

Choose Add...

And register an entry for this URL  https://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.4

After registering, when it presents available software to install, do not install
the SDKs. At a minimum, you need to install:

Google Plugin for Eclipse / Google Plugin for Eclipse 4.4/4.5

(you don't need anything else)

Proceed with installing this and restarting Eclipse.

(5) Re-open Eclipse, go to Window / Preferences

Open Google / App Engine and add the AppEngine SDK path that you downloaded and exploded in (5) in earlier section

Open Google / Web Toolkit and add the GWT SDK path of what you downloaded and exploded in (6) in earlier section

Choose OK to accept changes and close the preferences dialog.

(6) Once again, go to Window / Preferences

Open Server /Runtime Environment

Select Google AppEngine. If it complains about not having an AppEngine SDK the delete this
and select Add, choose Google / AppEngine, and accept the defaults to re-create it.

Select Apache Tomcat v6.0. If it complains about not having a configured runtime, then delete this.
Select Add..., Select Apache / Apache Tomcat v6.0 and set it up to point to your 
installation of Tomcat v6.0 on your system. Do not choose to create a new server; you are re-using 
the existing server.

Click OK to save changes.

(7) If you haven't already, go to the Workbench view. Then, 
Import / Import... / General / Existing Projects into Workspace

import these existing projects:

odk-mysql-settings
odk-posgres-settings
eclipse-tomcat6

(8) Depending upon which database you want to use:

(8a) MySQL: 

open odk-mysql-settings/common

edit security.properties to set the hostname to the IP address of your 
computer.

open odk-mysql-settings/mysql

edit jdbc.properties to specify a username, password and database name in the
url.

------e.g.,----------
jdbc.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc.resourceName=jdbc/odk_aggregate
jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/odk_db?autoDeserialize=true
jdbc.username=odk_unit
jdbc.password=test
jdbc.schema=odk_db
----------------

Save changes. 

Now open MySQL Workbench. If you have not yet created that database, 
issue the following commands, with the names changed for what you 
specified above. The names to substitute above/below are:

odk_db -- replace with your database name
odk_unit -- replace with your username
test -- replace with your password

-----corresponding db script------------
create database `odk_db`;
create user 'odk_unit'@'localhost' identified by 'test';
grant all on `odk_db`.* to 'odk_unit'@'localhost' identified by 'test';
flush privileges;
----------------------------------------

Finally, return to Eclipse, select the build.xml script within the odk-mysql-settings
project, right-click, Run As / Ant Build.

This will bundle up these changes and copy the changes into the eclipse-tomcat6 project.

(8b) PostgreSQL: 

open odk-postgres-settings/common

edit security.properties to set the hostname to the IP address of your 
computer.

open odk-postgres-settings/postgres

edit jdbc.properties to specify a username, password and database name in the
url.

------e.g.,----------
jdbc.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
jdbc.resourceName=jdbc/odk_aggregate
jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/odk_db?autoDeserialize=true
jdbc.username=odk_unit
jdbc.password=test
jdbc.schema=odk_db
----------------

Save changes. 

Now open pgAdmin III. If you have not yet created that database, 
issue the following commands, with the names changed for what you 
specified above. The names to substitute above/below are:

odk_db -- replace with your database name
odk_unit -- replace with your username
test -- replace with your password

-----corresponding db script------------
create database "odk_db";
SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false;
create user "odk_unit" with unencrypted password 'test';
grant all privileges on database "odk_db" to "odk_unit";
alter database "odk_db" owner to "odk_unit";
\c "odk_db";
create schema "odk_db";
grant all privileges on schema "odk_db" to "odk_unit";
----------------------------------------

Finally, return to Eclipse, select the build.xml script within the odk-postgres-settings
project, right-click, Run As / Ant Build.

This will bundle up these changes and copy the changes into the eclipse-tomcat6 project.

(9) Select eclipse-tomcat6, right-click, Refresh. (to pick up file changes).

(10) Select eclipse-tomcat6, right-click, Google / GWT Compile

Verify the program arguments are 

   -war WebContent
   
And the VM arguments are

    -Xmx512m
	
Apply and Compile.

(11) Select eclipse-tomcat6, right-click, Refresh. (to pick up GWT file changes).

(12) Select eclipse-tomcat6, right-click, properties, 

(13) Select the Servers tab in the Output area

Delete any existing Tomcat v6.0 server.

Click to create a server.

Choose Tomcat v6.0 Server

Enter the IP address of your computer. If you leave this as localhost, then ODK Collect
and ODK Briefcase will not be able to fully communicate with your development server.

Click Next

Configure to deploy eclipse-tomcat6 on this server.

Click Finish

(14) Select eclipse-tomcat6 project, right-click Properties
 
Go to Project Facets, select Dynamic Web App, click Runtimes tab, 
verify that Tomcat v6.0 is chosen.

Apply

Go to Server, select the Tomcat v6.0 server that you just created

Apply

Click OK

(13) You should now be able to run ODK Aggregate on this Tomcat6 server by 
right-click, Debug As / Debug on Server

The project may report a validation error (web.xml not found in WebContent).
You can ignore this. The web.xml is provided in war-base.

You may need to clear your browser cache if you are using GWT SuperDevMode
and re-configure the browser for that (e.g., the bookmark buttons).

========================================
Tomcat6 Edit-Debug Cycle Considerations
========================================

Now, you should be able to Debug the server-side code using the
Tomcat6 development server. When you are developing, as you 
change code, you will probably need to start and stop the server.

If you change the UI layer, you will want to re-run the GWT compiler,
and Refresh the eclipse-tomcat6 project, where the UI
code is.

You may need to clear your browser cache if you are using GWT SuperDevMode
and re-configure the browser for that (e.g., the bookmark buttons).

If you are working with GWT code, you can work in SuperDevMode
where you set breakpoints within the Chrome development environment.

See farther down (below) for configuring GWT.

If something is not picked up, you can try cleaning the project
and also Clean the server (via right-click on the server on the Servers
tab). This should refresh everything.  Unlike with AppEngine, this 
will not clear the content of your database. You would need to do 
that through your database admin tool (MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin III).

===============================
GWT debugging with SuperDevMode
-------------------------------

These instructions are taken from this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9270Yqt-5I

(1) In either the eclipse-ear or eclipse-tomcat6 project, 
right-click, Debug As / Debug Configurations

Double-click "Java Application" to configure a Java Application execution.

Change the name to, e.g., "AppEngine GWT Codeserver" or "Tomcat6 GWT Codeserver"

Choose Search... and type in Code

Select "CodeServer"

Choose Apply

Click on the (X)= Arguments tab

In Program Arguments, insert the 4 arguments (on one line):

--bindAddress [your IP address]
-src [path-to-workspace]\src\main\java 
-launcherDir [path-to-workspace]\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\wtpwebapps\eclipse-tomcat6  
org.opendatakit.aggregate.AggregateUI

The -launcherDir "tmp0" may be a different directory name (e.g., tmp1, tmp2...). 
Whichever one contains the eclipse-tomcat6 or eclipse-default is the one you would use.
If confused, you can stop all servers, blow away all the tmpX directories, and re-publish 
and re-run the server you have configured to determine what directory has the active content.

Choose Apply

Close

(2) Now, run the server (EAR or Tomcat6)

(3) And run the codeserver you just configured via Debug As / Debug Configurations, and select the configuration.

This will take a long long time, and then emit a URL that the code server is using.

(4) Open a Chrome browser to this URL.

Copy the Dev Mode On / Dev Mode Off buttons up to the bookmarks bar.  
You may need to delete an earlier copy of these by right-click / Delete.
And if you have been using Dev Mode, you may need to clear your browser cache.

(5) Now, open the URL to your server (tomcat6 or eclipse-ear).

It will pause compiling aggregateui

And then render the page. 

Choose "Dev Mode On"

(6) Then, to debug, go to Developer Tools 

There will be the standard Javascript Sources tab, and a new tab, Content Scripts.

The content Scripts tab will contain the Java code, and you can set breakpoints in that
to take effect on the browser, and step through everything there.

I believe you can make code changes in the Java source in Eclipse, and, when you 
save those changes, they will be picked up and applied after a short delay.

More info here:

http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html

==========================================
Troubleshooting Debugging/Running 
------------------------------------------

(1) Javascript refresh loop 

If the database schema has changed, the browser may flash
and be stuck in a javascript refresh loop.  To remedy,
delete your local datastore (instructions below)

(2) Odd behaviors under Eclipse

When you stop your server, be sure to recompile GWT files
(click on the red toolbox). And then right-click, Refresh.

You may also need to Clean and Publish to the server to 
ensure that the server has the very latest copies of those
files. 

Otherwise, when you restart the server, it may use a stale
copy of the compiled code.

You may also need to stop and start the codeserver during this
process.

Third, periodically clear your browser cache to force a complete
re-loading of the clientside javascript.

Fourth, if you have moved or changed client interfaces, you 
may need to manually browse to the war diretory and delete 
the contents of the war/aggregateui and war/WEB-INF/deploy
directories.  

(3) Odd errors about locking scopes.

If you are debugging code within a transaction
region (these are presently isolated to TaskLockImpl.java),
the datastore can get confused about the transaction scopes
that are active.  You may need to close eclipse, re-open, 
and delete the datastore to clear this problem.

-----------------------
Clearing your Datastore
-----------------------

To delete the local datastore, the easiest way to do this is to 
Clean your server, which will delete everything and republish it.
If you do this, you will first need to stop your server, stop
your codeserver (if debugging the UI), and then Clean, start the
server, and then start the codeserver (if debugging the UI). 

==========================================
Full Maven Development Environment Configuration
------------------------------------------

(1) Install Maven 3.  This document assumes Maven 3.0.4 or higher.
    This will generally set up a maven repository under
    the user's home directory:  ${HOME}/.m2/repository

(2) Install Java 7 JDK.

(3) Install Eclipse Mars.

(4) Install Google Eclipse Plugin with App Engine SDK and Google Web Toolkit SDK.

(5) Optionally Install Tomcat 6.0.  
    This is required unless you do not import or always keep closed
    the MySQL and Postgres projects and don't use maven.

(6) Optionally: Install Postgres

For Postgres, run these commands:

----postgres-script-start-----
create database "odk_unit";
create schema "odk_unit";
create user "odk_unit" with unencrypted password 'odk_unit';
grant all privileges on database "odk_unit" to "odk_unit";
alter database "odk_unit" owner to "odk_unit";
----postgres-script-end-------

From the Postgres SQL shell (psql) commandline client,
using the root account and password, if the above commands
are in the file postgres.sql, you can type:

\cd C:/your_path_no_spaces_forward_slashes_only
\i postgres.sql
\q

(6) Optionally: Install MySQL

(6a)
For MySQL, run this script:

UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('odk_unit') WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
CREATE USER 'odk_unit'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'odk_unit';
CREATE DATABASE odk_unit;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON odk_unit.* TO 'odk_unit'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

(6b)
For MySQL, download and copy the MySQL Connector J jar into the Tomcat /lib
directory (mysql-connector-java-5.1.17.jar to apache-tomcat-6.0.26/lib).
You must stop tomcat, if it is running, in order for the library to be detected.

For Maven (3) is optional; (4), (5) and (6) are required in order
to perform a full build.

----------

(7) Register libraries in Maven: (this is also required for Eclipse builds)

Run the ANT script (build.xml) under:

src/main/libs/ -- registers various jars into your local maven repo.

To run, just cd to this directory and type 'ant'

See the src/main/libs/readme.txt for information about these jars.

(8a) Download and install Chrome. The test scripts now use Chrome for 
the selenium testing rather than Firefox, which changed so often as to 
be unusable. You might need to update selenium and the Chrome Driver
for UI testing to work.  This is done in the build\build.xml file.

(8b) Download the App Engine SDK and selenium java client for full-stack integration / web UI tests.

Run the ANT script (build.xml) under:

build/   -- downloads the App Engine SDK and selenium java client (for full-stack integration / web UI tests)

To run, just cd to this directory and type 'ant'
 
(9) Edit Maven's settings.xml file (this is in the .m2 directory).

A minimal file is:

<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

	  </properties>
  	</profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>

Be sure to update the paths and passwords to match those of your environment.

If you are running on a Mac, change the webdriver.chrome.driver entry to:

		<webdriver.chrome.driver>/Users/Administrator/Documents/workspace/aggregate/build/chromedriver_mac32-2.20/chromedriver</webdriver.chrome.driver>

The installer is not hooked into the parent Maven project, but identifies that project as its
parent.  So you can build the top-level project to build and run unit tests, integration tests, 
etc. and do not need bitrock installed.

The aggregate-mysql war file is used as the starting point for the installer build process.

=========================
Maven Command Line Builds
=========================

(12) Maven command-line builds are done as follows:

mvn clean 

This cleans the workspace, removing all temporary files.
If this errors out, verify that there are no orphaned java
executables running. If the GAE tests crash, they can leave
a java database background process running.

mvn install

This will build and install the projects, running the unit tests
against the 3 datastores (Google BigTable, MySQL, Postgresql),
and building the wars for the 3 platforms.

(13) If you have bitrock installed and licensed, you can 
build the bitrock installer.  First, 
 copy aggregate-mysql\target\aggregate-mysql-1.0.war bitrock-installer
 cd bitrock-installer
 mvn clean
 mvn install
Open bitrock and open the buildWar.xml project file in this directory.
On the packaging page, build for windows, linux, linux-64 and OSX.

On Windows, the generated installers are placed under:

C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\InstallBuilder\output

NOTE: the bitrock installer construction process copies configuration files
from the eclipse-ear (EarContent/appengine-application.xml),
eclipse-default (WebContent/appengine-web.xml, WebContent/cron.xml, WebContent/queue.xml)
and eclipse-n-background (WebContent/appengine-web.xml) projects.

Changing those configuration files will alter the installer image.
